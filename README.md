## About the Project

The Last Man Standing Game is a decentralized "King of the Hill" style game implemented as a Solidity smart contract on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It creates a competitive environment where players vie for the title of "King" by paying an increasing fee. The game's core mechanic revolves around a grace period: if no new player claims the throne before this period expires, the current King wins the entire accumulated prize pot.

## Actors

This protocol includes the following roles:

### 1. Owner (Deployer)

**Powers:**

- Deploys the `Game` contract.
- Can update game parameters: `gracePeriod`, `initialClaimFee`, `feeIncreasePercentage`, `platformFeePercentage`.
- Can `resetGame()` to start a new round after a winner has been declared.
- Can `withdrawPlatformFees()` accumulated from claims.
  **Limitations:**
- Cannot claim the throne if they are already the current king.
- Cannot declare a winner before the grace period expires.
- Cannot reset the game if a round is still active.

### 2. King (Current King)

**Powers:**

- The last player to successfully `claimThrone()`.
- Receives a small payout from the next player's `claimFee` (if applicable).
- Wins the entire `pot` if no one claims the throne before the `gracePeriod` expires.
- Can `withdrawWinnings()` once declared a winner.
  **Limitations:**
- Must pay the current `claimFee` to become king.
- Cannot claim the throne if they are already the current king.
- Their reign is temporary and can be overthrown by any other player.

### 3. Players (Claimants)

**Powers:**

- Can `claimThrone()` by sending the required `claimFee`.
- Can become the `currentKing`.
- Can potentially win the `pot` if they are the last king when the grace period expires.
  **Limitations:**
- Must send sufficient ETH to match or exceed the `claimFee`.
- Cannot claim if the game has ended.
- Cannot claim if they are already the current king.

### 4. Anyone (Declarer)

**Powers:**

- Can call `declareWinner()` once the `gracePeriod` has expired.
  **Limitations:**
- Cannot declare a winner if the grace period has not expired.
- Cannot declare a winner if no one has ever claimed the throne.
- Cannot declare a winner if the game has already ended.
